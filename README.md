# Calories_Burnt_Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting the number of calories burnt during physical activities based on various input parameters. The model takes data such as the type of activity, duration, and other relevant factors to estimate the calories burned. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions. It aims to create a model that can predict how many calories a person burns based on inputs like the type of exercise, duration, age, weight, and other factors. This prediction can help users to track their fitness and make better decisions in their workout routine.

**Key Features:**
Input Features: Activity type, duration, age, weight, and possibly other physical data.
Output: Predicted calories burned.
Machine Learning Model: Various regression models to predict calories burned.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Programming language used for data processing and modeling.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Scientific computing for numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization.

**Installation**
To run the project locally, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/rajthakkar18/Calories_Burnt_Prediction.git
      cd Calories_Burnt_Prediction

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

3. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

**Usage**
Once you have the environment set up, you can run the project in the following steps:

1. Prepare the dataset (if not already available).

2. Train the model by running the provided Python script:
  python train_model.py

3. To make predictions with a pre-trained model:
  python predict_calories.py --activity "Running" --duration 30 --weight 70 --age 25

**Dataset**
The dataset used for training the model includes information such as:

Activity Type: Running, Cycling, Swimming, etc.
Duration: Duration of the activity in minutes.
Weight: Weight of the individual in kilograms.
Age: Age of the individual.
Calories Burnt: The target variable representing the calories burnt during the activity.

**Model**
The model uses machine learning regression techniques to predict the calories burnt. Different algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) have been experimented with to find the most accurate model.

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and feature engineering.
2. Model training: Using Scikit-learn to train various models.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better accuracy.
4. Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

**Results**
Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated on a test set. The model's accuracy is assessed using standard regression metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

You can find the evaluation results in the results/ folder or the output logs.
